# Nefino.LI public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official Nefino.LI public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nefino/projects/8)[^1]

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. The roadmap repository is for communicating Nefinoâ€™s roadmap for [nefino.li](https://nefino.li). Existing issues are currently read-only, and we are locking conversations, as we get started. Interaction limits are also in place to ensure issues originate from Nefino.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **release phase** that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- An **application** that indicates the feature or product to which the item belongs. For a list of current features, see below. 

- Once a feature is delivered, the issue will be closed with a comment linking to the relevant [Changelog](https://docs.nefino.li/changelog/) post.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- **ga:** *Generally available to all customers*\
Ready for production use with technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from in design.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows: 

- **in design:**\
Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- **exploring:**\
Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.  You'll also find an **Exploratory** column, which is used in conjunction with the **in design** and **exploring** release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

## Application

The following is a list of our current features and products, with distinct labels for filtering:

- **geo:** Nefino.LI Geo
- **news:** Nefino.LI News

_More labels will be added in the future as needed._
